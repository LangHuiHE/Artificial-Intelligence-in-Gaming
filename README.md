## TeamDraft
The Pokemon franchise recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. Pokemon GO (POGO) is a recent mobile application, which celebrated 5th anniversary a few months ago. In one popular competition format for POGO PVP, players choose a team of 6 unique pokemon to bring to the tournament.

In this assignment, we will choose pokemon to draft into our team of 6 that will give us a good chance in a tournament.

Match-ups between all pairs of pokemon, call the pair (a, b), allowed in the tournament have been ranked with a score in the range [0, 1000]. 500 means a tie, < 500 means that a loses, and > 500 means that a wins. The further the score is from 500, the more extreme the outcome.

The team's utility will be calculated as described here: For each pokemon allowed in the tournament, find the team member pokemon with the second best score vs the tournament pokemon. This is the team's score vs that one pokemon. Find the minimum of these scores. That is the teams utility.

Use **local search (hill-climbing, simulated annealing, restart)** to find the **5 best teams**.
