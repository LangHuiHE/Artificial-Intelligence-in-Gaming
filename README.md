## PokemonGo TeamDraft
The Pokemon franchise recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. Pokemon GO (POGO) is a recent mobile application, which celebrated its 5th anniversary a few months ago. In one popular competition format for POGO PVP, players choose a team of 6 unique pokemon to bring to the tournament.

In this assignment, we will choose pokemon to draft into our team 6 which will give us a good chance in a tournament.

Match-ups between all pairs of pokemon, call the pair (a, b), allowed in the tournament have been ranked with a score in the range [0, 1000]. 500 means a tie, < 500 means a loss and > 500 means that wins. The further the score is from 500, the more extreme the outcome.

The team's utility will be calculated as described here: For each pokemon allowed in the tournament, find the team member pokemon with the second-best score vs the tournament pokemon. This is the team's score vs that one pokemon. Find the minimum of these scores. That is the team's utility.

Use **local search (hill-climbing, simulated annealing, restart)** to find the **5 best teams**.
